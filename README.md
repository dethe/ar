Augmented Reality Experiments for Richmond Public Library

To try it out, print out the file `2D Markers 1-12.pdf`. You can cut the 12 markers apart or keep them together as you wish. On your phone or tablet visit https://dethe.github.io/rpl-ar/ and allow camera access when prompted. Point the camera at the markers and you should see models pop up over them.

I will hopefully be changing the 3D images frequently.
